# LEDtower
This repository has the arduino code that controls our LED tower, as well as some schematics, data sheets and media about the project.

The LED tower is a cylindrical tower made of copper with an 8 by 16 grid of controllable RGB LED's around it.
It's possible to control each LED and change it to any of 16 million available colors. This allows the user to make animations, games, displays and other things via software. The whole tower refreshes at roughly 120Hz.
